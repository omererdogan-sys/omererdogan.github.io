Reflection Questions,


How is a Button different from .onTapGesture?
A button has this function built in and the way exactly we write the code is different. We can also compare these with a text box in terms of difference.
2 Why might we want multiple input methods?
To get more specilized outputs, and not bneone fits all
3 Which input felt most natural to you? Why?
The input which felt the most natural was the on tap gesture or what works such because the hour block and the minute block works together like its real life.

4 How does this show event-driven programming?
In this program there is an event alone, not much process or such. You click it moves a d event driven programings is likely the programming type driven by  events in the app like this.
