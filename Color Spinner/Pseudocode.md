1- How will your program decide the color?
A random number generator would be used able to show numbers 1,2,3 and for example if 1 it displays a color and under else there is another if to choose which color of the 2 under else to display.
2- What happens when the user taps the Spin button?
The function will run, and the random number is chosen and goes through the loop and changes the color of the rectangles and changes display to “purple”.
3- Which variables does your app need?
It needs a lits to make it easier and a variable tied to a random number kind of.
4-  Which part will be written as a function?
The parts under the spinned part would be written as functions. Like how a random number is generated, after it goes through the process to be decided as which color then the UI is changed finally. Other parts are less and these are the (major) parts inside the function
5-  Why are nested conditionals needed in this simulation?
I have not understood this fully. I expect both have to similar effect but testing may show a difference.
