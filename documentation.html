    <h2>Collabration</h2>
    <p>We encountered some difficulties in our project such as some errors. Usually the errors were minimal and the code was short so it was not very difficult solve. Also most errors were either logic errors or writing errors.</p>

    <h2>Swift Calculator</h2>
    <p>Doing this no rememberable major error took place. We basically had 2 input locations and buttons/ontapgestures to decide what will be the outcome of the numbers calculation, basically to choose the calculatoion and then the rs-esult was printed from text.</p>
    
    <h2>XOX Scratch</h2>
   <p>This section there was more and more difficult errors. The main problem was setting up the winner detector. For this I did the following code. Under changing costumes of each box to its X or O form for example it was like if costume changed to constume for x bellow it a variable I defined a 1a if it was the first square was set to one and if O to 1b nd so on. and then I added another character which would tell the score like a bear and then I started a forever loop under when start is clicked and inside it an if else look. İnside the if there was every option of the numbers with a's therefore under it it wrote X wins and there was else. Under else there was another if block meant for if O won and if it was not it either and 8 or 9 clicks were completed i.e all boxes was filled the game said it was a tie.</p>
   
    <h2>XOX Swift</h2>
    <p>This one was the most difficult by far. I was not able to complete it fully. we used VStake and HSTake and some box codes to make grid basically and added X and O adder. But the winner detector was so difficult I believe or I was just not able to understand how to do it and got stuck.</p>

    <h2>Portrait</h2>
    <p>I combined different shapes on a stack going back, I tried to choose the right shapes, like a capsule for face and tried to pyt them at the right layer and then to make a ethically permissible portrait. Again no major error, the main thing was choosing  the sizes of the shapes and the layers.</p>

    <h2>Clock V1</h2>
    <p>In this project I made a clock which, when tapped moved by 15 minutes and that was it. I have no errors in mind but the main layers was setting up the on tap gesture and increasing a variable when clicked, and when clicked 4 times increase hour by 1 and possibly have a minute part behind the screen to link it to the angle of the rectangles on the clock. And reset the values when the right time comes like minute=60 or hour=24.</p>

    <h2>Clock V2</h2>
    <p>In this version we had an upgraded clock, in ways like multiple ways of input like +hour -hour and increase minute by 15. This was not too hard but the main error I think I got was linking the minute part to the angle of the rectangle therefore writing it was too long so I recommend linking them at the beggining or working from the minute variable if possible.</p>

    <h2>Clock V3</h2>
    <p>The main difficulty was in this part laying the shapes properly as this is similar to clock V1 but with overlays, and the main harness as I remember was putting the shapes at the right placers which is not really a technical issue.</p>
    
    <h2>Clock V5</h2>
    <p>In this we had foreach loop which was not too hard to cover but the hardest was linking the random hour and the rectangle's position which used a similiar code to the following: var ba=Double(hours) * 30</p>

     <h2>Decimal Binary</h2>
    <p>In this one şt was hard to think what to do but after some help I put some foreach's inside each other which operates 0-1 for all of them and there is a calculation, the calculation of turning decimal to binary. but the error I am not yet able to solve is defining the function properly as I couldn't do it even after many times of workimng on it.</p>
