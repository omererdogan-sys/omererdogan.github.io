    <h2>Github Website</h2>
    <p>During the process the first issue was adding multiple pages which was solved pretty quickly then for projects I embedded links in the project names and it now looks like it works properly but for aesthetics the websşte is still lacking but fills the purpose I used mostly html's for the website. </p>
    <h2>Collabration</h2>
    <p>We encountered some difficulties in our project such as some errors. Usually the errors were minimal and the code was short so it was not very difficult solve. Also most errors were either logic errors or writing errors.</p>

    <h2>Swift Calculator</h2>
    <p>Doing this no rememberable major error took place. We basically had 2 input locations and buttons/ontapgestures to decide what will be the outcome of the numbers calculation, basically to choose the calculatoion and then the rs-esult was printed from text.</p>
    
    <h2>XOX Scratch</h2>
   <p>This section there was more and more difficult errors. The main problem was setting up the winner detector. For this I did the following code. Under changing costumes of each box to its X or O form for example it was like if costume changed to constume for x bellow it a variable I defined a 1a if it was the first square was set to one and if O to 1b nd so on. and then I added another character which would tell the score like a bear and then I started a forever loop under when start is clicked and inside it an if else look. İnside the if there was every option of the numbers with a's therefore under it it wrote X wins and there was else. Under else there was another if block meant for if O won and if it was not it either and 8 or 9 clicks were completed i.e all boxes was filled the game said it was a tie.</p>
   
    <h2>XOX Swift</h2>
    <p>This one was the most difficult by far. I was not able to complete it fully. we used VStake and HSTake and some box codes to make grid basically and added X and O adder. But the winner detector was so difficult I believe or I was just not able to understand how to do it and got stuck.</p>

    <h2>Portrait</h2>
    <p>I combined different shapes on a stack going back, I tried to choose the right shapes, like a capsule for face and tried to pyt them at the right layer and then to make a ethically permissible portrait. Again no major error, the main thing was choosing  the sizes of the shapes and the layers.</p>

    <h2>Clock V1</h2>
    <p>In this project I made a clock which, when tapped moved by 15 minutes and that was it. I have no errors in mind but the main layers was setting up the on tap gesture and increasing a variable when clicked, and when clicked 4 times increase hour by 1 and possibly have a minute part behind the screen to link it to the angle of the rectangles on the clock. And reset the values when the right time comes like minute=60 or hour=24.</p>

    <h2>Clock V2</h2>
    <p>In this version we had an upgraded clock, in ways like multiple ways of input like +hour -hour and increase minute by 15. This was not too hard but the main error I think I got was linking the minute part to the angle of the rectangle therefore writing it was too long so I recommend linking them at the beggining or working from the minute variable if possible.</p>

    <h2>Clock V3</h2>
    <p>The main difficulty was in this part laying the shapes properly as this is similar to clock V1 but with overlays, and the main harness as I remember was putting the shapes at the right placers which is not really a technical issue.</p>
    
    <h2>Clock V5</h2>
    <p>In this we had foreach loop which was not too hard to cover but the hardest was linking the random hour and the rectangle's position which used a similiar code to the following: var ba=Double(hours) * 30</p>

     <h2>Decimal Binary</h2>
    <p>In this one şt was hard to think what to do but after some help I put some foreach's inside each other which operates 0-1 for all of them and there is a calculation, the calculation of turning decimal to binary. but the error I am not yet able to solve is defining the function properly as I couldn't do it even after many times of workimng on it.</p>

    <h2>Ice Cream Overflow</h2>
    <p>In this code we were given an outline by the teacher and defining variable colors took my attention. Also there was not much errors when I did. What we did was add the code for each of the buttons and add the scoops visualy and make them have the color scoop1 for first scoop for example and so on.</p>
    
     <h2>Frog Escape</h2>
    <p>Firstly the part about making the timer and maving the objects move and making obstacles and detect touching looked hard but now after strong help and basing my code of off AI and seeking understanding of it I can write a similar code and for the rest of my documantation: What was the hardest part of timing logic? The hardest part of the timing was not much but likely functions related to it which I got help from chatgpt via cheatsheet. I still have a dunction not fully understood but I got over all the difficulites to my understanding (almost) with help and code from chatgpt. Now I believe by questioning and trying to understand I can write the code of the game fully or near fully maybe even a little upgraded with little (possibly) help, where as I wrote the code trying to understand everypand every part of chatgpt and doing mostly so and then pasting it and doing a minor adjustment and some additions like adding a clock for the timer that works with the time variable. How did you use if, for, and functions? if's was used to detect if the user was touchinf any obstacles or the blue goal mainly, and also to detect if the game was over as a result of it and likely some more. functions were used for example to run when game's over or for a new level or time's for levels and such. What happens when your clock overflows? It says game over and asks to restart with the new button. It resets on time(not levels as I think its for time but may add it if its required.</p>
    
     <h2>Initials with Code/h2>
    <p>This was kind of srait forward this was done using circles. As it was supposed to be 10x10 I used offset to get the same axis parts away from each. I also simulated the cşrcles using foreach and 10 times then made like some of the last circles be in the same place so it looks 10x10 instead of like 11x10 I also used H stack and V stack seperately according to the line required and irs need of axis.</p>

    <h2>Chocalot Machine</h2>
    <p>I couldn't achive this perfectly with some errors, I think as minor. I intend to try to fix it by the night of the 26th, as I completed the code a few days ago and didn't realize any major error but now checking when uploading it I saw some. But my code was basically a function which works with real life minutes and a variable temp and everytime the minute increases temp increases by 5 and according to the temp the answer is given what to do.</p>
