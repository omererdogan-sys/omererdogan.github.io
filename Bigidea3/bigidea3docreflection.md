- How do loops and conditionals make your programs more dynamic?
It can give outputs more special to the user. And not same for every value and user. And loops can be used for levels and other exiting features.

- Why is it important to test algorithms with different inputs?
To test if it works as requested in all the domain for example if a beginner is trying to get the functionâ€™s inverse of a linear one his inverse should be the inverse of all the data not some or almost all.
- Which part of this activity helped you understand algorithm design the most?
This was possibly the part 3 . As it was bit longer which in my opinion was better to understand an algorithm atleast a bit better than just 1 print alone(exegerated).
