Big Idea 2 — Data
Programs can process data to help us discover information and create new knowledge.
Part A — Understanding Data and Information 
1- What is the difference between data and information?
Data is plain. When we process it and find results/generalization or such we extract the information of the data and that what it means or can mean.
Write in your own words.
2- Give one example of data and the information you could find from it.
Example: Data → “3, 5, 7.” Information → “The numbers are odd.”
3- How can computers help us find patterns or trends in data?
Computers work much faster than human and can find patterns much easily. For example they might help in even biological gene patterns to find what gene might do what. This can help extract information from the data.
4- What does correlation mean?
Give one example of two things that are correlated but not caused by each other.
People buying umbrellas and the fish  activity
5- Why is it important to remember that “correlation does not mean causation”?
Because it is true and missing is a grave error and may even mean saying because that man is making more sales fish are more active today which is not probable I guess.
Part B — Metadata (10 pts)
6- What is metadata?
Explain in one sentence.
It is the data about the data itself.
7-  Give two examples of metadata that an image might include.
The date the image was taken
The place the image was taken
Look at two images:
Image A = 3.2 MB
Image B = 400 KB
Which one is more compressed? How can you tell?
9- Does changing metadata (like file name or date) change the image itself? Explain.
It doesnt but it may effect the information extracted as changing the date an image was taken or the place it was taken was to p-hypothetially changed from the meta data the original image wouldn’t change.
10- How can metadata help a photo app organize your pictures automatically?
By sorting it and making lists which we can fins them easier like on the map it shows what photos you took where and where you zoom on the map it shows the photographs, it also sorts snow places cities and such. Which makes this easier.

Part C — Processing and Cleaning Data 
1- What problems might happen if your data includes missing or repeated values?
Processing errors and might dirty the pure data.
2- What does it mean to clean data?
To remove or to clean that dirty part in the data.
3- Why is cleaning data important before analyzing it?
Because for example you are analyzing average age and a person writes their age as 1041765183787958379 years old it will make the information gained non realistic and even maybe fake.
Part D — Bias, Scale, and System Limits (
4- Why can big data sets be hard for one computer to process?
Because computers have limits which they cannot pass like a carometer with max of 999 cannot show 1000.
5- Give one example of how data collection could create bias.
The givers of the information acting differently to the collector than how they feel.
Part E — Reflection (
6- What was the most interesting thing you learned about data or metadata?
That meta data is like very useful and in some cases may be as important as data I think as I thought I think that meta data usually sat on the side.
7- Why is data cleaning important for getting accurate results?
Because it alters the results with false data and with false data there comes inaccurate results.
8- How can metadata help us organize digital information?
We can sort data by one of its specific meta data type like the day/week a video was taken or where and so on.
9- What’s one example of bias that could happen in real life?
A teacher asking students to evaluate their class and the students are much less likely to say that it was bad or to critisize the teacher heavily.
10-How does processing data help humans make better decisions?
With genaralizing many important things. For example what may happen if we eat x much sugar a day and data can be processed to tell maybe its very bad for one’s health and that may make the person make a more conscious decision.
