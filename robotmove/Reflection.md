1) What was the main purpose of your program? Explain what your robot is designed to do and what kind of experience it provides to the user.
It is used for basic usage of controls and it trains the ujser touse simple buttoninteractions for moving and it can translate into other usages.

2) Choose one of your procedures that includes parameters. Explain how this procedure reduces complexity, increases reusability, and changes the program’s behavior based on the parameter values.
It is the win checker and it is relatively simple. It constantly works and when the player wins it displays that the character did so.

3) Describe the main algorithm in your program that includes a list (array), a loop, and at least one conditional. Explain how these components work together to control your robot’s behavior. This may be the part of displaying the colors. For it there is a loop/function and the foreach to simulate all the squares work with the loop that it is supposed to run being either 1…9 or 1…10. These work together to show player and cscore location and the other squares.

4)Describe a technical challenge or bug you encountered during development. How did you approach solving it, and what strategies helped you overcome it?
It was trying to change a state variable inside view and inside VStack so I turned it in to a kind of function like and put it voutside and so it worked by calling the function. 

5)Where did you use nested if/else statements in your program? If you did not use them, how could you redesign your code to include nested conditionals so the robot can make more complex decisions? Provide an example scenario.
I  hadnt used them but I coulve used them for location guide for example is a player is atm square 50 and the score at 75 it coulve said its on your right down.
