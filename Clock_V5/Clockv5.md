• How did ForEach make your code simpler?
It help us put all 12 numbers at their respected positions instead of doing all of them one by one and that shortened the code a lot.
• What did you learn about randomness in programming?
I learnt that it can be giiven to variables in the requested range like 1-24 in out case and help do randomness/luck based things on games that is not fixed.
• Which part was most challenging: design, logic, or input/output?
The most challanging was I think would fall under logic. It was linking the rectangles together with the hour as in my code they worked independantly techniquely. And tlinking them was hard for the random hours and in the random hour they shell work together properly so cant give random's to both so they needed to work together.
• How is this project similar to Scratch’s “repeat” and “pick random” blocks?
I think repeat would here replace the foreach code block and pick random is the giving random value to the variability. Forexample if we had to replicate the Foreach in scratch we maybe could've worte the required code in a repeat 12 times block.
