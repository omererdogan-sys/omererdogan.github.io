    <h2>1.1 Collaboration:</h2><p>Computer invations are new things that come up that are related to coding or computers. An example of this was a new super Mario Brothers Game and it had roots in collabration of the producer and the user by the user giving feedback and therefore the producer improving the game.<p>
     <h2>1.2. Programme Design and Development:</h2><p>In program design after the basic program is out the developer has to rely artially on the user/tester as they give beneficial feedback to improve it and develop the app to its final form and to get more attention.<p>
     <h2>1.3. Programme Function and Purpose:</h2><p>A programs fuction and purpose are fdifferent. The purpose is the original intended funtion. LÄ°ke whatsapp as a safe way to chat but as more people started using it and more feedback came the developer acted accordingly and now you can share histories do calls send voice messages and so on and thats its function compared to chatting being its purpose.<p>
     <h2>1.4. Identifying and Correcting Errors:</h2><p>There is 4 basic errors. A logic error which works but doesnt do what its intended for, a sytax(type) error an overflow error and a run-time error. There are different ways to trace the bugs and fix them such as testing the code, hand tracing, using debuggers, using visualizations and extra print statements.<p>

       <h2>2.1. Binary Numbers:</h2><p>Firstly the compressed sound recordings for example can be given as examples to digital data but analog data is more continious like a smooth line but digital one works in interwals, like a digital clock only showing minutes and hours but analog clocks show even smaller parts if it works constantly. Secondly in binary system the value is either 0 or 1 and everything on computers are represented using them. This is very complicated and we can't directly undertsand it so abstaction is used. And for example in a system of 2 the first number, for example if 6 digited binary, will be 2 to the power of 6 and so on. and if 0 is given to it we dont have it and if 1 is given we have it. This is a way integer data can be represented in binary form.<p>
     <h2>2.2. Data Compression:</h2><p>A compression is meant to reduce file size, which has 2 types, lossy and lossless. Lossy loses some data but has a much smaller size possibly. for example 111000 is compressed like (3,1)(as there is 3 1's first then)(3,0) but lossy compression converts/ deletes some data to for example to turn 10111 to (4(or)5,1).<p>
     <h2>2.3. Extracting Information from Data:</h2><p>In big data there are more comprehensive paterns even though correlation isnt just proof of a casual relationship. It suggests area for research or such. Also there is meta data which is shortly data about data, like its name, when it was created or last edited or the owner and so on. Cleaning data cleanes the data and makes it kind of uniform like a type answer for whats who's favorite class and makes it more uniform I guess.<p>
     <h2>2.4. Using Programs with Data:</h2><p><p>
