    <h2>1.1 Collaboration:</h2><p>Computer invations are new things that come up that are related to coding or computers. An example of this was a new super Mario Brothers Game and it had roots in collabration of the producer and the user by the user giving feedback and therefore the producer improving the game.<p>
     <h2>1.2. Programme Design and Development:</h2><p>In program design after the basic program is out the developer has to rely artially on the user/tester as they give beneficial feedback to improve it and develop the app to its final form and to get more attention.<p>
     <h2>1.3. Programme Function and Purpose:</h2><p>A programs fuction and purpose are fdifferent. The purpose is the original intended funtion. Lİke whatsapp as a safe way to chat but as more people started using it and more feedback came the developer acted accordingly and now you can share histories do calls send voice messages and so on and thats its function compared to chatting being its purpose.<p>
     <h2>1.4. Identifying and Correcting Errors:</h2><p>There is 4 basic errors. A logic error which works but doesnt do what its intended for, a sytax(type) error an overflow error and a run-time error. There are different ways to trace the bugs and fix them such as testing the code, hand tracing, using debuggers, using visualizations and extra print statements.<p>

       <h2>2.1. Binary Numbers:</h2><p>Firstly the compressed sound recordings for example can be given as examples to digital data but analog data is more continious like a smooth line but digital one works in interwals, like a digital clock only showing minutes and hours but analog clocks show even smaller parts if it works constantly. Secondly in binary system the value is either 0 or 1 and everything on computers are represented using them. This is very complicated and we can't directly undertsand it so abstaction is used. And for example in a system of 2 the first number, for example if 6 digited binary, will be 2 to the power of 6 and so on. and if 0 is given to it we dont have it and if 1 is given we have it. This is a way integer data can be represented in binary form.<p>
     <h2>2.2. Data Compression:</h2><p>A compression is meant to reduce file size, which has 2 types, lossy and lossless. Lossy loses some data but has a much smaller size possibly. for example 111000 is compressed like (3,1)(as there is 3 1's first then)(3,0) but lossy compression converts/ deletes some data to for example to turn 10111 to (4(or)5,1).<p>
     <h2>2.3. Extracting Information from Data:</h2><p>In big data there are more comprehensive paterns even though correlation isnt just proof of a casual relationship. It suggests area for research or such. Also there is meta data which is shortly data about data, like its name, when it was created or last edited or the owner and so on. Cleaning data cleanes the data and makes it kind of uniform like a type answer for whats who's favorite class and makes it more uniform I guess. Data may be biased as well we can avoid this with better questions for example or with a bigger data with many different variables except what we are looking If I can explain what I mean.<p>
     <h2>2.4. Using Programs with Data:</h2><p>All programs use data but the most visually possible ones to us maybe like google sheets or microsoft excel as they are meant to store data possibly to with requested variables. For data processing programs the easiest to think of may be google or chat gpt as they browse data and filter them and process them according to what the used asked and give output according to that from all of the data. Transforming data is basically hanging a data for example form cm to km or ml to l and many more examples. Or you might visualize the data using graphs and charts for example.<p>

       <h2>3.1. Variables and Assignments:</h2><p>A variable is a placeholder that stores a value. You can assign a value to a variable (for example: `age ← 17`). Data types matter (number, text, boolean, etc.), and variable names are case‑sensitive.</p> <h2>3.2. Data Abstraction:</h2><p>Using abstractions like lists (or arrays) and strings lets you store and manipulate more complex data. A list can hold multiple elements; each element has an index. Abstraction simplifies how you handle and organize data inside programs.</p> <h2>3.3. Mathematical Expressions & Sequencing:</h2><p>Programs follow a sequence of instructions (statements) executed one after another. You can use mathematical expressions (with operators, order of operations, maybe MOD/remainder) to compute values or transform data in your program.</p> <h2>3.4. Strings:</h2><p>Strings represent sequences of characters (words, sentences). You can combine (concatenate) strings, extract parts (substrings), and use them to build text output, messages, or process textual data in programs.</p> <h2>3.5. Boolean Expressions & Logic:</h2><p>Boolean values (true/false) let the program make decisions. Using relational operators (like <, >, ==) and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) you can compare values or conditions and control program flow based on those conditions.</p> <h2>3.6. Conditionals & Nested Conditionals:</h2><p>If‑else statements let a program choose between different paths depending on a condition. Nested conditionals are conditionals inside other conditionals — useful when decisions are more complex or layered.</p> <h2>3.7. Iteration (Loops):</h2><p>Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times (e.g. “repeat until …” or “for each item in a list”). This is useful when you want to perform the same operation many times without writing the same lines over and over.</p> <h2>3.8. Lists and Collections:</h2><p>Lists (or arrays) allow you to store many values under a single variable name. You can add, access, modify, or iterate through lists — helpful for handling groups of data like survey results, scores, names, etc.</p> <h2>3.9. Procedures (Functions) & Modularity:</h2><p>Programs become easier to manage when you group related instructions into procedures (or functions). Instead of repeating code, you can write a procedure once and call it whenever needed. This helps reduce duplication and errors.</p> <h2>3.10. Developing Algorithms & Problem‑Solving Logic:</h2><p>An algorithm is a step‑by‑step plan for solving a problem. In programming, you translate algorithms into code. Good design and clear logic are essential so your program works correctly and efficiently.</p> <h2>3.11. Algorithmic Efficiency & Complexity:</h2><p>Some algorithms are faster or more efficient than others. Efficient algorithms use fewer resources (time, memory) and run faster — important when data or tasks are large. Understanding efficiency helps choose the best solution.</p> <h2>3.12. Advanced Concepts (Search, Randomness, Simulation):</h2><p>Programs can use search algorithms (like binary search), randomness, and simulation to solve more complex problems. Simulations help model real‑world processes, while randomness and search help explore different scenarios or data sets.</p>
