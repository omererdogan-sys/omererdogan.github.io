This reflection covers the basics of the videos and some questiosn left in my mind ater them after thinking of the missing points that could've been expanded. Also the reflection shortly inckudes why the topics are important and how do they connect to computing.

The video I found the most interesting was likely turning binary code in to decimals. Also the last video about graphs and spreadsheets to organize data was interesting aswell.

Overall I learned how is data managed basicly with errors like overflows and organized with graphs etc. and some about meta data and importantly binary code and how it represents many things like numbers.
