What was the hardest part of timing logic?
The hardest part of the timing was not much but likely functions related to it which I got help from chatgpt via cheatsheet. I still have a dunction not fully understood but I got over all the difficulites to my understanding (almost) with help and code from chatgpt. Now I believe by questioning and trying to understand I can write the code of the game fully or near fully maybe even a little upgraded with little (possibly) help, where as I wrote the code trying to understand everypand every part of chatgpt and doing mostly so and then pasting it and doing a minor adjustment and some additions like adding a clock for the timer that works with the time variable.
How did you use if, for, and functions?
if's was used to detect if the user was touchinf any obstacles or the blue goal mainly, and also to detect if the game was over as a result of it and likely some more. functions were used for example to run when game's over or for a new level or time's for levels and such.
What happens when your clock overflows?
It says game over and asks to restart with the new button. It resets on time(not levels as I think its for time but may add it if its required.
