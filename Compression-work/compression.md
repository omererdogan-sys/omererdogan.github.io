Paper Questions

1.What is lossless compression? - What is lossy compression? 
A lossless compression is the file completely being compressed without giving away any data in the process of compresssion.
A lossy compression is a type that compresses the file in greater ranges compared to the other one but it loses some information especially the minor ones in the process.

2. Why might someone choose lossy compression for a video or song, even though some quality is lost?
This may be because these lost information and quality is very minor compared to the compression abality for example the quality lost in these cases are mostly minor sounds like the ones the humans cannot hear properly.

3. Why is lossless compression required for text documents?
This may be because of the communication need and formality. For example in an importatn document if something is misrepressented it may cause great problems and lossless compression doesn't do such things.

To fill this table I seperately used a voice recording and a photo. The first zip is the video

      File Size(KB)    Visible / Audible Changes?    Lossless or Lossy?    Notes

PNG  1518                No                           Lossless             Was higher quality barely compared to JPEG possibly

JPEG  399              A little                       Lossy                Had a little noticable quality in my opinion.

MP3  968                No                            Lossly                At most very hardly recognazable changes

ZIP1 748                No                            Lossless              Very similar to the mp3 no notable changes or such

ZIP2 396                No                            Lossless              This was In my opinion the highest quality image and somehow the highest compression.




Tool 1-Low Quality 30 MB to 2.3MB    %92 Reduction    No big notable change

Tool 1-Middle Quality 30 MB to 9.2MB    %69 Reduction    No big notable change as higher quality


Tool 2-"KalÄ±n" Quality 28.65 MB to 10.60 MB %63 Reduction  No expected big change

Tool 2-"Temel" QUality 28.65 MB to 22.92 MB  %20 Reduction  No expected big change


Summary: I think the best balance between quality and size were the ZIP files in the beggining as they were quality in my opinion and very low size for what they gave as output.
Lossy compression is mostly acceptable in my opiion except when its a little more nuanced like important audio recordings or documents. Our experimnent may show abstaction in computer science
as follows, by us not analyzing what the computers bits turns to from how much to how much, either we learn what happens to the file and if it lost data and such in simple terms.
